### **Vocabulary** 

**def:**In the context of natural language processing (NLP), vocabulary refers to the set of unique words that appear in a text corpus.The vocabulary is used to represent text in a machine-readable format. For example, if the vocabulary contains 10,000 words, then each text document can be represented as a vector of 10,000 numbers, where each number represents the frequency of a particular word in the document.

The vocabulary is an important part of NLP because it allows us to represent text in a way that can be processed by computers. Without a vocabulary, it would be very difficult to develop NLP algorithms that can understand and process natural language.

There are a few different ways to create a vocabulary for NLP. One common approach is to use a statistical method to select the **most frequent words** in a text corpus. Another approach is to use a **dictionary of words** that are considered to be important for a particular task.



 ## **How does sentiment analysis work**
 
Sentiment analysis typically works by first identifying the sentiment of individual words or phrases. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as **lexicon-based analysis**, **machine learning**, or **natural language processing**.

Once the sentiment of individual words or phrases has been identified, they can be combined to determine the overall feeling of a piece of text. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as **sentiment scoring** or **sentiment classification**.

Background: machine-learning classification task of sentiment analysis. In this example you have the tweet, letâ€™s say, Iâ€™m happy because Iâ€™m learning NLP. And the objective in this task is to predict whether a tweet has a positive or negative sentiment. And youâ€™ll do this by starting with a training set where tweets with a positive sentiment have a label of one, and the tweets with a negative sentiment have a label of zero.


In order for you to implement logistic regression, you need to take a few steps. In this tutorial you will learn about the steps required in order to implement this algorithm, so letâ€™s take a look.

## **Supervised Machine Learning** 

In supervised machine learning, you have input features X and a set of labels Y. Now to make sure youâ€™re getting the most accurate predictions based on your data, your goal is to minimize your error rates or cost as much as possible. And to do this, youâ€™re going to run your prediction function which takes in parameters data to map your features to output labels Y hat.

Now the best mapping from features to labels is achieved when the difference between the expected values Y and the predicted values Y hat is minimized. Which the cost function does by comparing how closely your output Y hat is to your label Y. Then you can update your parameters and repeat the whole process until your cost is minimized. So letâ€™s take a look at the supervised

##  **Logistic Regression and Sentiment Analysis**?

Logistic regression is a statistical model used to predict binary outcomes. It is commonly used when the dependent variable is dichotomous, meaning it can take only two values. In the context of sentiment analysis, the binary outcome represents the sentiment category (positive or negative).

Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It is well-suited for sentiment analysis because it can handle text data and provide probabilistic outputs. Logistic regression models are interpretable and can capture nonlinear relationships between features and labels.

Logistic regression works by estimating the probability of an event occurring based on a set of independent variables. It uses a logistic function (also known as a sigmoid function) to map the linear combination of the independent variables to a value between 0 and 1. This value represents the probability of the event occurring.

For this task you will be using your logistic regression classifier which assigns its observations to two distinct classes. Next up Iâ€™ll show you how to do this. So to get started building a logistic regression classifier thatâ€™s capable of predicting sentiments of an arbitrary tweet.

You will first process the raw tweets in your training sets and extract useful features. Then you will train your logistic regression classifier while minimizing the cost. And finally youâ€™ll be able to make your predictions. So in this blog you learned about the steps required for you to classify a tweet. Given the tweet, you should classify it to either be positive or negative. In order for you to do so, you first have to extract the features. Then you have to train your model. And then you have to classify the tweet based off your trained model. In the next video, youâ€™re going to learn how to extract these features. So letâ€™s take a look at how you can do that

###  **Preparing the Data**
Before we can build a sentiment analysis model, we need to prepare the data. This involves cleaning and preprocessing the text, as well as labeling the data with sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

###  **Feature Extraction**
Feature extraction is a crucial step in sentiment analysis. It involves converting the text into numerical features that can be used by a machine learning model. Some common feature extraction techniques for sentiment analysis include 
- bag-of-words,
- TF-IDF
- word embeddings.

###  **Building the Logistic Regression Model**

Once we have extracted the features, we can build our logistic regression model. We will use the scikit-learn library in Python to implement logistic regression. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the testing data.

###  **Evaluating the Model**

To evaluate the performance of our sentiment analysis model, we can use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into how well our model is performing in classifying sentiment.

###  **Improving the Model**

There are several ways to improve the performance of our sentiment analysis model. One approach is to experiment with different feature extraction techniques and see which one works best for our dataset. We can also try using more advanced machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods to improve accuracy.

###  **Real-World Applications**

Sentiment analysis has a wide range of real-world applications. It can be used in social media monitoring to analyze customer opinions and feedback. Companies can use sentiment analysis to understand customer satisfaction and make informed business decisions. Sentiment analysis can also be applied in product reviews, brand monitoring, and market research.
Sentiment analysis has several applications, such as:

**Understanding customer sentiment** in social media, product reviews, and survey responses to find out what customers think about your products and services, and to make improvements accordingly.

**Automatically generating product** recommendations based on users' sentiment towards them.
Identifying influencers who have a positive or negative influence on public opinion and who may be relevant for advertising your products.
Tracking the sentiment of a brand or product over time to improve the brand or adjust marketing efforts. This type of analysis can be done on competitors as well.

**Monitoring employee morale**. This information can be useful to managers as it helps them identify problem areas that may need to be addressed. It can also help them see how employees are responding to changes within the company, such as new policies or initiatives.

##  **Challenges and Limitations**

While sentiment analysis has proven to be effective in many cases, it does have its limitations. One major challenge is dealing with sarcasm and irony in text, as these can often lead to misinterpretation of sentiment. Sentiment analysis models may also struggle with domain-specific language or slang. Additionally, sentiment analysis is subjective and can vary based on cultural differences and individual interpretations.

##  **Conclusion**
In conclusion, sentiment analysis using logistic regression is a powerful technique for understanding the sentiment expressed in text data. By preprocessing the data, extracting relevant features, and building a logistic regression model, we can accurately classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis has numerous applications in various industries and can provide valuable insights for decision-making processes. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and challenges in order to obtain reliable results.
