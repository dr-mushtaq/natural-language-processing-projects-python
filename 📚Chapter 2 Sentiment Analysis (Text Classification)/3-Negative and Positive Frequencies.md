A frequency dictionary is a specialized type of lexicon used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that organizes words based on their frequency of occurrence within a specific corpus. This tool is particularly beneficial for linguistic research, language learning, and various applications in text analysis.

#  **What is the frequency dictionary (Bar)** 

A frequency dictionary in NLP is a list of all the unique words occurring in a corpus, along with their frequencies. The frequency of a word is the number of times it appears in the corpus. Frequency dictionaries are used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as:

# Key Applications of Frequency Dictionaries in NLP

- **Document classification:** Frequency dictionaries can be used to represent documents as vectors of word frequencies. This can then be used to train machine learning models to classify documents into different categories.

- **Sentiment analysis:** Frequency dictionaries can be used to identify the sentiment of a document. For example, a document that contains a lot of words with positive sentiment scores is likely to be positive, while a document that contains a lot of words with negative sentiment scores is likely to be negative.

- **Topic modeling:** Frequency dictionaries can be used to identify the topics of a document. This is done by clustering words together based on their frequencies. The clusters of words are then used to represent the topics of the document.

# How Are Frequency Dictionaries Created?

- Frequency dictionaries can be created manually or automatically. Manually created frequency dictionaries are created by counting the frequency of each word in a corpus.
- Automatic frequency dictionaries are created using statistical techniques.

# Using Frequency Dictionaries for Logistic Regression

Weâ€™ll now learn to generate counts, which you can then use as features in your logistic regression classifier. Specifically, given a word, you want to keep track of the number of times, thatâ€™s where it shows up as the positive class. Given another word you want to keep track of the number of times that word showed up in the negative class. Using both those counts, you can then extract features and use those features into your logistic regression classifier.
