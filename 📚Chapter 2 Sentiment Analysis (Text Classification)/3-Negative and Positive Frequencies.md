A frequency dictionary is a specialized type of lexicon used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that organizes words based on their frequency of occurrence within a specific corpus. This tool is particularly beneficial for linguistic research, language learning, and various applications in text analysis.

#  **What is the frequency dictionary (Bar)** 

A frequency dictionary in NLP is a list of all the unique words occurring in a corpus, along with their frequencies. The frequency of a word is the number of times it appears in the corpus. Frequency dictionaries are used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as:

# Key Applications of Frequency Dictionaries in NLP

Building a vocabulary usually involves:

- Selecting the most frequent words from a corpus (statistical method).
- Using a custom dictionary relevant to a specific task (domain-based method).

 # **Feature Extraction**
## Sparse Representations

Letâ€™s take these tweets and extract features using your vocabulary. To do so, youâ€™d have to check if every word from your vocabulary appears in the tweet. If it does like in the case of the word I, you would assign a value of 1 to that feature, like this. If it doesnâ€™t appear, youâ€™d assign a value of 0, like that.

In this example, the representation of your tweet would have six ones and many zeros. These correspond to every unique word from your vocabulary that isnâ€™t in the tweet.

</p>

Now, this type of representation with a small relative number of non-zero values is called a sparse representation. Now letâ€™s take a closer look at this representation of these tweets. In the last slides, I walked you through extracting features to represent the tweet based on a vocabulary and I arrived at this vector.

This representation would have a number of features equal to the size of your entire vocabulary. This would have a lot of features equal to 0 for every tweet. With the sparse representation, a logistic regression model would have to learn n plus 1 parameters, where n would be equal to the size of your vocabulary and you can imagine that for large vocabulary sizes, this would be problematic. It would take an excessive amount of time to train your model and much more time than necessary to make predictions.

Given a text, you learned how to represent this text as a vector of dimension V. Specifically, you did this for a tweet and you were able to build a vocabulary of dimension V. Now as V gets larger and larger, you will face certain problems. In the next video, you will learn to identify these problems.

# Simple Python Example: Building a Vocabulary

Below is a simple demonstration using scikit-learnâ€™s CountVectorizer to automatically build a vocabulary and extract features.


<pre>
# Import the necessary library
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import pandas as pd

# Example corpus
tweets = [
    "I am happy",
    "I am learning NLP",
    "NLP is fun"
]

# Create a CountVectorizer instance
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the data
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(tweets)

# Convert the result into a DataFrame for clarity
df = pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

print("Vocabulary:", vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print("\nFeature Representation:\n", df)

 </pre>

Vocabulary: ['am' 'fun' 'happy' 'is' 'learning' 'nlp']
Feature Representation:
   am  fun  happy  is  learning  nlp
0   1    0      1   0         0    0
1   1    0      0   0         1    1
2   0    1      0   1         0    1
