Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. It has gained significant popularity in recent years due to the rise of social media and the need to understand customer opinions and feedback. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform sentiment analysis using logistic regression with Python.

### **What is Sentiment Analysis** 
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that aims to understand and categorize the sentiment expressed in a given text. It involves analyzing the words, phrases, and context of the text to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. It has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its applications in various fields such as marketing, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of sentiment analysis and delve into the details of using logistic regression as a powerful tool for sentiment classification.

In this section, we will provide an overview of sentiment analysis and its importance in today‚Äôs data-driven world.

Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting subjective information from text and determining the sentiment or emotion associated with it. It involves analyzing the text to classify it into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. The main goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the opinions, attitudes, and emotions expressed by individuals or groups. This information can then be used to make informed decisions, improve customer service, and gain valuable insights.

**Def:** Sentiment analysis has been widely used since the early 20th century, and its research area is still fast growing. One of the most advanced solutions is to use AI to proceed with sentiment analysis. The algorithm uses a natural language processing (NLP) technique which enables it to determine the moods or emotions of a piece of text. In this case, companies can react based on user feedback.

**Def:** Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) [2] technique used to determine the sentiment of a text by automatically identifying its underlying opinions. The sentiment can be positive (e.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy today‚Äù), negative (e.g. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like that movie‚Äù), or neutral (e.g. ‚ÄúToday is Friday‚Äù, which may be subjectively seen as positive by some people actually üòÅ) [1]

 ## **How does sentiment analysis work**
 
Sentiment analysis typically works by first identifying the sentiment of individual words or phrases. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as **lexicon-based analysis**, **machine learning**, or **natural language processing**.

Once the sentiment of individual words or phrases has been identified, they can be combined to determine the overall feeling of a piece of text. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as **sentiment scoring** or **sentiment classification**.

Background: machine-learning classification task of sentiment analysis. In this example you have the tweet, let‚Äôs say, I‚Äôm happy because I‚Äôm learning NLP. And the objective in this task is to predict whether a tweet has a positive or negative sentiment. And you‚Äôll do this by starting with a training set where tweets with a positive sentiment have a label of one, and the tweets with a negative sentiment have a label of zero.


In order for you to implement logistic regression, you need to take a few steps. In this tutorial you will learn about the steps required in order to implement this algorithm, so let‚Äôs take a look.

### **Supervised Machine Learning** 

In supervised machine learning, you have input features X and a set of labels Y. Now to make sure you‚Äôre getting the most accurate predictions based on your data, your goal is to minimize your error rates or cost as much as possible. And to do this, you‚Äôre going to run your prediction function which takes in parameters data to map your features to output labels Y hat.

Now the best mapping from features to labels is achieved when the difference between the expected values Y and the predicted values Y hat is minimized. Which the cost function does by comparing how closely your output Y hat is to your label Y. Then you can update your parameters and repeat the whole process until your cost is minimized. So let‚Äôs take a look at the supervised

###  **3-How does computer vision work**?
Computer vision technology tends to mimic the way the human brain works. But how does our brain solve visual object recognition? One of the popular hypothesis states that our brains rely on patterns to decode individual objects. This concept is used to create computer vision systems [5].Computer vision algorithms that we use today are based on pattern recognition. We train computers on a massive amount of visual data ‚Äî computers process images, label objects on them, and find patterns in those objects. For example, if we send a million images of flowers, the computer will analyze them, identify patterns that are similar to all flowers and, at the end of this process, will create a model ‚Äúflower.‚Äù As a result, the computer will be able to accurately detect whether a particular image is a flower every time we send them pictures.
Computer vision works in three basic steps:

1- **Acquiring an image**

Images, even large sets, can be acquired in real-time through video, photos or 3D technology for analysis.

2- **Processing the image**

Deep learning models automate much of this process, but the models are often trained by first being fed thousands of labeled or pre-identified images. Computer vision algorithms are based on pattern recognition. We train our model on a massive amount of visual(images) data. Our model processes the images with label and find patterns in those objects(images).

3- **Understanding the image**

The final step is the interpretative step, where an object is identified or classified.

###  Real life Example

For example, If we send a million pictures of vegetable images to a model to train, it will analyze them and create an Engine (Computer Vision Model) based on patterns that are similar to all vegetables. As a result, Our Model will be able to accurately detect whether a particular image is a Vegetables every time we send it .
