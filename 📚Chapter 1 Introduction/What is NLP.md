# **1- Introduction** 
In a world where communication reigns supreme, the ability to understand and interact with human language is invaluable. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to making this possible. From powering virtual assistants to analyzing vast amounts of text data, NLP plays a pivotal role in shaping the way we interact with technology and each other.

# **2-Why NLP is so important?**

By now we have to work with a huge amount of data. In Machine Learning we mainly work with those numerical values. How we can get some actions on text data like news reports, social media comments and posts, and customer reviews in the online stores? We can use Natural language processing techniques to do that..Not only that, Even now we have made daily work easier by using applications made from NLP. Summarization applications, spell checker applications, and machine translations are some of them .

Computers and machines are great at working with tabular data or spreadsheets. However, human beings generally communicate in words and sentences, not in the form of tables. Much information that humans speak or write is unstructured. So it is not very clear for computers to interpret such. In natural language processing (NLP), the goal is to make computers understand the unstructured text and retrieve meaningful pieces of information from it  

Well NLP is cool and stuff, but how can we leverage it to improve our businesses more efficiently? How it could differ from the more traditional techniques?‚Äù [5].As we have said before, NLP allows machines to effectively understand and manipulate human languages. With that, you will be able to automate a lot of tasks and improve their rapidity and scale, like data labeling, translation, customer feedback, and text analysis. Applying NLP to real-world cases and not just for research purposes, will bring a significant competitive advantage to many businesses.

# **3- What is NLP?**

NLP is primarily about developing systems that allow machines to communicate with humans in their natural language. It encompasses two key areas:

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The goal here is to make machines comprehend and interpret human language. NLU allows systems to recognize the intent behind the text or speech, extracting key information such as emotions, entities, and actions. For instance, when you ask a voice assistant ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather like?‚Äù, NLU helps the system determine that the user is asking for weather information.

**Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Once a machine understands human input, NLG takes over by generating appropriate responses. An example of this is AI writing assistants that can craft sentences or paragraphs based on the data provided.

**Def: Natural language refers** to the medium in which humans communicate with each other. This could be in the form of writing (text) for example emails, articles, news, blogs, bank documents, etc, or speech for example lectures, speeches, audio calls, etc. NLP is one of the major AI technologies aimed at making machines capable enough to interpret speech and text-based human language.

**Def: Natural Language Processing** is a branch of linguistics, AI, and CS for the manipulation, and translation of natural language which gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human language. Simply put, NLP is a set of computational techniques that allow machines to understand and manipulate human spoken languages. But how is that possible?

There are trillions of web pages full of natural text, so imagine the scale of data available today. NLP algorithms often model the hierarchical structure of natural language i.e. characters form words, words form phrases, phrases form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, and paragraphs form documents .

Natural Language Processing (or NLP for short) consists of developing a set of algorithms and tools so that machines can make sense of data available in natural (human) languages such as English, German, French, etc. Although there are traces of NLP research since a long time ago, the concept got well defined in the 1950s, with the breakthrough research work of Alan Turing and Noam Chomsky. Natural language refers to the medium in which humans communicate with each other. This could be in the form of writings (text) for example emails, articles, news, blogs, bank documents, etc or speech, for example, lectures, speeches, audio calls, etc. There are trillions of web pages full of natural text, so imagine the scale of data available today.NLP algorithms often model the hierarchical structure of natural language i.e. characters form words, words form phrases, phrases form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, and paragraphs form documents.
